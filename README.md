  eInk display as a replacement for tombstones

Abstract
========

  Determine if interactive displays add value to the tombstone experience.

Indroduction
============

  We talked with BKIN about eInk kiosks. One place where this may be useful is in tombstones.
  We aim to determine if eInk displays can perform all the same functions as current tombstones,
  and see if they can enhance engagement without detracting from the art and curatorial message.
  By using the nook, an android-based eInk display that is available for under $100, we can write
  websites to deliver content.

  Sub-Experiment I is to determine how well the nook handles multilingual support, and if that is
  valuable and discoverable for the musuemgoer.

Materials and Methods
=====================

  Nook Simple Touch
  microSD card [optional]
  wifi access [optional]

Procedure
=========

  * Acquire a Nook Simple Touch
  * Root using touchnooter
  * either serve up this repository using something like `python -m simpleHttpServer` or copy this repository to the root of the microSD card
  * browse and enjoy!

Results
=======

  The nook browser can display multiple languages using @font-face declarations
  The nook browser has a limited amount of information it can display - some tombstones are larger than practical to fit on one screen

Discussion
==========

  We should explore interactivity
  More work needs to be done in accessibility guidelines (font sizes, mainly)

Conclusion
==========

  None Yet
